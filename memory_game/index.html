  	<h2>Instructions</h2>
  	<p>Concentration, also known as Match Match, Match Up, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.</p>
  	<h3>What's fun about it? Why should people play?</h3> 
  	<p>This game is a great family card game. You can play it with a regular pack of cards, or with picture cards that your child might like. </br> Younger players are often able to compete with older players because they can be very good at memory-based games. </p>
